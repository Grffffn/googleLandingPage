<!---Nothing in CSS calls the element itself. A "#" calls the id which is nested in the element. A "." calls the class, also nested
     An element can have many different classes but only one id. It is bestr practice to use classes to identify things in the css.
     Priority for styling is Inline -> ID - Class - Element. -->

<!--My current plan is to use CSS grid to create a 3 x 3 grid (ala tick-tac-toe) all inside of one div. My logic is that if the main div, henceforth called "mainpage", can be
    centered in the body I can easily use CSS grid to section parts of it off to contain the main contents of my page. The middlemiddle square of the grid
    will pose the biggest challenge. At present I am considering either to use CSS Flexbox to styel the few objects inside of the middlemiddle square
    or simply using divs to section it off. My gut tells me using divs will be easier but using FB inside of Grid will let me flex both muscles and learn
    multiple technologies. I will update this when I get to that portion of the styling-->

    <div class="mainpage">
        <!--for the classes I have abbreviated them based on their location in the grid. "tL" would mean topLeft. "mM" would be middleMiddle
            and "bR" would be buttomRight. I have done this to make programming easier and to eliminate the risk of a typo throwing off the styling.
            hopefully this makes debugging easier.-->
